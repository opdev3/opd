# OPD 0.7
A P2P lending and borrowing service on Tezos network

---


The functionality of this service consists of three steps:

1. **Borrow.** Create a borrow request by providing the necessary information, like the choice of a token you want to borrow ( = the reward token), the number of tokens to borrow, the number of tokens as collateral and the reward, time (loan term). There is an optional field *"Deadline"* for liquidation of the request if it wasn't accepted by a creditor.
2. **Lend.** View borrowing requests from other users and lend requested tokens.
3. **Deals.** View and repay existing deals - both borrowings and lendings
